    <p>Hello sir/madam,

        It's my pleasure to speak with you. I am Sai Lakshmi. Basically, I belong to Guntur. I have been living in Guntur for 27Years/6months now. I stay here with my family. Besides my parents, there is a elder sister and younger sister in my family. Currently, I am exploring job opportunities in the Fullstack as I have recently finished M.Tech from JNTUK. <br>
        
        I am very interested in the Fullstack Developer. That was the reason I chose to pursue Addskills in CourseLearning. Post that, my seminars experience and other practical projects in the college further boosted my interest in MangoDB, Photoshop.... <br>
        
        Not only am I passionate about the field I graduated in CSE, I am also inclined towards creative activities such as dancing, acting, etc. I have always been an active student in school and college. I have participated in many cultural events during my school and college days and have won awards.
        
        In my free time, I enjoy going out with friends and trying new cuisines. I also enjoy watching movies, listening to music, reading, working out, and cooking.
        
        I am looking forward to knowing more about this opportunity and I will be happy to answer more questions.
    </p>
